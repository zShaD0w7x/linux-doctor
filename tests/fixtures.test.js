/**
 * Recorded machine fixtures.
 *
 * A fixture is a real machine's command outputs (captured with
 * LINUX_DOCTOR_RECORD, see CONTRIBUTING.md) replayed through the real pipeline.
 * The clean-image gate in CI covers bare containers; these cover the desktops
 * and laptops those images cannot represent — the case where a check fires
 * because of what a real system printed, not because of what we assumed.
 *
 * A fixture is a promise about behaviour, so it fails on:
 *   - a hardware-fault code appearing (scripts/baseline-lib.mjs NEVER_ON_CLEAN);
 *   - a high/medium finding with no justification in `expected`;
 *   - an expectation that still carries a TODO reason.
 * Host-dependent codes (memory/load/updates) are tolerated, same list as the gate.
