 * reorganised into packaging/aur/ and the script kept pointing at
 * packaging/PKGBUILD, so a release stopped halfway through and left the RPM
 * spec and the docs regeneration un-run, silently.
 *
 * This reads the paths out of the script and checks they exist, which is the
 * failure it would have caught.
