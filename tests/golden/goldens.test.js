/**
 * Golden snapshots — the full-output regression net.
 *
 * Each state from docs/output-parity.md's matrix is rendered through all
 * three text channels and compared byte-for-byte against the committed
 * snapshot. A wording change, an ordering change, a dropped line: anything
 * fails here with a reviewable diff instead of slipping out silently.
 *
 * Snapshots update ONLY via `npm run goldens:update` — never by hand — so a
 * snapshot change always shows up as a reviewable diff in the PR that
 * intentionally changed the output.
