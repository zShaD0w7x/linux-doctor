**Linux diagnostics that explain the problem and remember what changed.**

Linux Doctor runs safe, read-only checks and surfaces only the issues that
actually matter. Each finding comes with an explanation and a copy-paste fix. It
remembers your last run, so every report tells you what's new, what got fixed,
and what stayed the same.

> Its own code never modifies your system. Drop-in checks
> (`~/.config/linux-doctor/checks/`) and the Pro add-on are code that **you**
> install and run with your own privileges. See
> [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#plugins-custom-checks).

- One clear next step. Every report leads with START HERE, the single most useful
  action, not a wall of graphs.
- Memory built in. A health score (0-100), a trend sparkline, and a plain
  NEW/FIXED diff on every run.
- Read-only by construction. It never changes your system; fixes are suggestions
  you run yourself. The optional `--fix` shows a dry run first, and running it
  takes a second opt-in.
- CLI, web dashboard and desktop app (Tauri) run the exact same checks.
- Runs from `npx`, npm, an RPM, a `.deb` or the AppImage, and works on immutable
  distros (Silverblue, Bazzite).

## Why Linux Doctor?

Linux already has the data. `journalctl`, `systemctl --failed`, `df`, `free`,
`smartctl`. What it does not give you is the answer: you get raw output and you
have to find the line that matters. Linux Doctor reads the same sources and
returns the **conclusion**: what is wrong, why it matters, and the command to
fix it.

It is deliberately **a doctor, not a monitor**. It does not stream metrics,
manage processes, or sit in the background waiting to page you. It answers
"what's wrong right now?" in seconds, remembers the previous answer, and tells
you what changed. That is a different job from a monitoring stack:

| Tool | Job |
|---|---|
| Uptime Kuma, Beszel, Netdata | always-on metrics, uptime, alerting |
| Cockpit | interactive server administration |
| `inxi` / `neofetch` | hardware and system *inventory* |
| **Linux Doctor** | **diagnose → explain → suggest a fix → remember what changed** |

Run it when something feels off, before filing a bug report, or daily from a
`systemd` timer. You get one clear next step instead of a wall of graphs. Use it
alongside your monitoring stack, not instead of it.

## Download the app (recommended)

Desktop app — no install, no package manager:

- **[Latest release](https://github.com/zShaD0w7x/linux-doctor/releases/latest)** — grab `linux-doctor-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`

```bash
chmod +x linux-doctor-*-x86_64.AppImage
./linux-doctor-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

Also attached to each release: `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm`
(Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE) and the CLI tarball.
AppImage runs on most distributions (glibc-based); on immutable systems
(Fedora Silverblue, Bazzite) it works out of the box. **Nothing needs to be
installed** — the desktop packages embed their own Node.js 22 runtime
(`<resources>/runtime/node`), so the app's checks run even on a machine with
no Node on `PATH`. `LINUX_DOCTOR_NODE=/path/to/node` still overrides it.

> Installed size: the bundled runtime adds roughly 130 MB to the package.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting: blank/white window or EGL errors (AppImage, very new Mesa)</summary>

The bundle's WebKitGTK comes from an older LTS base; its accelerated paths can
abort against bleeding-edge host Mesa (`Could not create default EGL display`)
or paint a blank/white webview. This is about the host's driver stack, not the
GPU brand: **AMD and Intel** graphics (and nouveau) all run on Mesa and are
equally exposed; NVIDIA's proprietary driver ships its own stack.

**Current builds handle both automatically** before any GTK/WebKit code runs:

- the AppImage defaults to software GL (a diagnostics dashboard does not need
  GPU anyway) — set `LINUX_DOCTOR_HARDWARE_GL=1` to force hardware rendering;
- WebKit's DMA-BUF renderer is disabled (the usual cause of a white window) —
  set `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=0` to opt back in.

On older builds, launch with either (or both):

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 ./linux-doctor-*-x86_64.AppImage
# still blank? also try:
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 ./linux-doctor-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

If it is **still** blank, the AppImage's **bundled** WebKitGTK is incompatible
with your host's driver stack (seen on very new Mesa and NVIDIA). Install the
`.deb`/`.rpm` — or the [OBS package](#install--first-run-cli) — instead: those
use the WebKitGTK shipped by your distribution, which matches the host.
</details>

## Install & first run (CLI)

Needs Node.js ≥ 20.

```bash
npx github:zShaD0w7x/linux-doctor     # no install, straight from GitHub
# or:
npm install -g linux-doctor && linux-doctor
```

Prefer a native CLI package?

- **Arch / AUR:** `makepkg -si` from the [PKGBUILD](packaging/aur/PKGBUILD) (AUR package `linux-doctor`)
- **Fedora / RHEL / Bazzite / openSUSE:** add the [OBS repository](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:7sh1d0w7x:linux-doctor) and `sudo dnf install linux-doctor`, or build with the [linux-doctor.spec](packaging/linux-doctor.spec)
- **Debian / Ubuntu:** `.deb` from [Latest release](https://github.com/zShaD0w7x/linux-doctor/releases/latest)
- **Any glibc distro:** AppImage or `npx github:zShaD0w7x/linux-doctor`

```
STATUS   0 high, 2 medium, 19 info · health 74/100
TREND    ▄▅▅▆▆▇  last 6 run(s) · 61 → 74 ▲

▶ START HERE   #1 System is low on usable memory
               Close apps you are not using, then re-run this check.

Your system is low on usable memory: 9.4 GB of 15 GB is in use and 2.2 GB is
being pushed to swap. This is the most common cause of a sluggish desktop.
How to fix: close unused browser tabs, then re-run this check.

Since last run: 2 new · 1 fixed · 19 unchanged
```

The report leads with a **▶ START HERE** line (the single most useful
action) and a **TREND** sparkline, and every run is diffed against the
previous one. Read-only by default: `--fix` prints a dry-run plan of
commands sourced only from a small built-in safe-fix catalog — running it
needs a second opt-in (`--fix --yes`), and `[manual]` items always stay
yours to run.

## What it checks

Every finding carries a stable identity: a `code` (`check/reason`), a
severity decided against the [severity rubric](docs/severity.md), human
detail, evidence from the system, and a suggested fix. Codes are the join
key for history diffing (NEW/FIXED) and for `--ignore-code`, so they never
change silently.

| ID | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `memory` | RAM pressure, swap usage |
| `load` | CPU load vs core count |
| `disk` | Real partitions near full (ignores virtual/immutable roots) |
| `inodes` | Inode usage — “No space left” with free space showing in `df -h` |
| `fs` | Filesystem errors (btrfs, read-only remounts) |
| `raid` | Software RAID health (mdadm/ZFS) — degraded arrays, resync in progress |
| `oom` | Out-of-memory kills |
| `zram` | Swap/zram health — compressed swap near full, swappiness |
| `locales` | System locale — missing/broken locale generation |
| `services` | Failed systemd services (system + user); services stuck in a restart loop |
| `certs` | TLS certificate expiry (certbot state + actually-deployed certs on local TLS ports) |
| `ports` | Risky services (databases, FTP/Telnet) listening outside localhost without a firewall |
| `fds` | File-descriptor pressure (`/proc/sys/fs/file-nr` near the kernel limit) |
| `timers` | Scheduled tasks — enabled systemd timers that never run |
| `journal` | Error log, with known-benign noise filtered out |
| `journald` | System journal (log) disk usage |
| `suspend` | Failed suspend/resume hooks (laptops) |
| `containers` | Container runtimes — podman/docker installed and usable; dead, OOM-killed (exit 137), or restart-looping containers |
| `containerdisk` | Container image storage (podman/docker) — hidden disk usage |
| `crash` | Crash and reboot history (coredumps + unexpected restarts, correlated with automatic-update mechanisms) |
| `security` | Firewall, SELinux, update services |
| `ssh` | SSH server posture — root login, password authentication |
| `autologin` | Automatic login enabled in the display manager |
| `secureboot` | UEFI boot mode, Secure Boot state, TPM presence |
| `network` | Default route and DNS resolution |
| `ntp` | Clock synchronization (time sync daemon state) |
| `wifi` | WiFi — rfkill blocked, NetworkManager disabled, adapter presence |
| `updates` | Pending package updates (dnf/apt/pacman) |
| `snap` | Pending snap refreshes and the snapd auto-refresh timer |
| `firmware` | Pending firmware (BIOS/UEFI) updates via fwupd |
| `flatpak` | Pending Flatpak app updates + unused runtimes (`flatpak uninstall --unused`) |
| `reboot` | Newer kernel installed but not booted, pending restart |
| `processes` | Top memory consumers, with friendly names |
| `thermal` | CPU temperatures and thermal-throttling events |
| `battery` | Laptop battery level and capacity wear (skipped on desktops) |
| `gpu` | Graphics driver health (NVIDIA proprietary vs nouveau vs missing, software rendering) |
| `gpu-usage` | GPU VRAM pressure (NVIDIA/AMD) — nearly-full VRAM flagged (AI/ML OOM risk) |
| `bluetooth` | Bluetooth controller presence and daemon state |
| `wayland` | Display session type, running compositor, software rendering |
| `audio` | Sound server (PipeWire/PulseAudio) and output device (desktop/laptop) |
| `backup` | Backup/snapshot tools installed, scheduled, and actually running (stale backups flagged) |
| `fstrim` | SSD TRIM — weekly fstrim.timer enabled or continuous discard mounting |
| `hardware` | Machine check exceptions and corrected ECC memory errors |
| `smart` | Disk SMART health (needs root or smartmontools) |
| `luks` | Full-disk encryption (LUKS) presence |
| `boot` | Boot partition space and bootloader config (`/boot` full, missing `grub.cfg`) |
| `cache` | User cache and trash bloat (`~/.cache`, `~/.local/share/Trash`) |
| `packages` | Package manager health — broken/locked apt/dnf/pacman database |
| `orphans` | Orphaned packages (`pacman -Qtd`, `apt autoremove`, `dnf autoremove`) |

Checks that don't apply to your machine — `battery` on a desktop, `reboot`
on immutable systems — are skipped automatically and reported honestly in a
**Skipped** section instead of producing misleading findings.

## Health score & history

Every run is saved to `~/.local/share/linux-doctor/history.json` (override
with `LINUX_DOCTOR_HISTORY`). From that history you get a **health score
(0–100)** with an auditable breakdown (`100 − Σpenalties`), a **TREND**
sparkline of your last runs, and a plain-language **diff per run** — new,
fixed, unchanged. Findings that share a root cause are collapsed before
scoring, so one problem never counts twice. History is a bonus, never a
dependency: `--no-history` disables it, and if it cannot be written the
report still works.

## Community

Questions, ideas and show-your-setup go to
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/zShaD0w7x/linux-doctor/discussions);
bugs and check requests to [Issues](https://github.com/zShaD0w7x/linux-doctor/issues).
Contributions are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Roadmap

- ~~GUI with a one-click report~~: shipped as a Tauri desktop app
- ~~Report history and change detection~~: shipped (health score, NEW/FIXED diff)
- ~~More checks (Bluetooth, Wayland, backup, hardware errors, LUKS)~~: shipped
- Auto-generated, distro-specific fix instructions
- Signed packages on AUR/COPR and AppStream metadata in every package (Flatpak is not a fit; see [packaging/README.md](packaging/README.md))
- Maintenance: single maintainer, AI-assisted. Roadmap lives in the CHANGELOG and
  in GitHub issues. Security fixes within days, contributions welcome.

## Transparency and evidence

Development is AI-assisted, and every decision is the author's. Don't take the
README's word for it; the artifacts are public:

- [616 automated tests](tests/): golden snapshots for every output format,
  shell-safety tests for the fix catalog, and output-parity tests that keep the
  CLI and the dashboard in agreement.
- [CI](https://github.com/zShaD0w7x/linux-doctor/actions/workflows/ci.yml) runs
  the whole report on Fedora and on Node 20, 22 and 24, plus the Rust app on
  `fmt`, `clippy` and `cargo audit`.
- A clean-image gate runs the engine inside Fedora, Debian, Alpine and Arch
  containers and fails when a high or medium finding appears that the baseline
  does not justify. Recorded machine fixtures (real command outputs, scrubbed)
  replay the same way, and every finding they produce needs a written reason.
- Read-only by construction, with a pinned safe-fix catalog. The egress paths
  scrub findings and refuse private endpoints by default, and
  [docs/doctrine.md](docs/doctrine.md) lists what the tool refuses to do, each
  claim tied to the test that enforces it.
- Every change is in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md); releases are signed tags.

## Editions

This repository **is** the Free edition — the whole product for everyday
users, GPL-3.0-or-later, forever. Optional paid tiers for power users and
companies are strictly additive and described in
[COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md](COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md).

## Licensing & brand

**Dual-licensed.**

- [GPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE) — free for individuals and open-source projects. You may copy, modify and redistribute it, but any derivative work you distribute must stay open-source under the same terms.
- [Commercial license](COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md) — for companies that need to use Linux Doctor inside proprietary products.

Details on what the GPL grants and requires: [docs/licensing.md](docs/licensing.md).

What that means in practice:

- **Copying the Free edition is allowed** — that is the point of the GPL. Forks are welcome as long as they keep the license and the notices.
- **It is still not a free-for-all**: a distributed derivative must stay GPL, and shipping the code inside a closed product requires the commercial license. That obligation is enforceable copyright, not a polite request.
- **The paid tiers' code is not here.** Pro/Business/Enterprise live in private repositories; this edition is, and stays, the whole product for everyday users.
- **The name and logo are not covered by the code license.** If you fork, ship it under your own name — see [docs/trademark.md](docs/trademark.md).

Every source file carries an `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later` header. By contributing, you agree your contributions are offered under both licenses (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
