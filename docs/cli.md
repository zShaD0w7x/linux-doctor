# CLI reference

Everything the `linux-doctor` command can do. For the big picture — what the
tool is, downloads, and the check list — see the [README](../README.md).

Every run is read-only unless you explicitly opt in to `--fix --yes`.

**Exit codes:** `0` if nothing serious was found, `1` if there are
high/medium findings, `2` on errors — so the report works in scripts and
cron jobs.

## Health score

Every run gets a **health score (0–100)**: 100, minus 15 per high-severity
and 8 per medium-severity finding — with escalation inside a tier so
problems compound honestly: each additional high beyond the first costs +5
more (15, 20, 25, 30 …), and mediums past the third cost +1 more. Four
failed units must not land anywhere near a pile of annoyances. Findings that
report the same root cause (e.g. software rendering, detected by both the
`gpu` and `wayland` checks) are collapsed into one before scoring, so one
problem never counts twice. The arithmetic is auditable: `scoreBreakdown`
travels in `--json`, and the terminal report prints one compact line under
STATUS (`SCORE 77/100 = 100 −15 disk/full …`), pinned by tests so
`100 − Σpenalty === score`.

--help            usage
--version      version
```

## Fixing issues safely (`--fix`)

Linux Doctor is read-only by default. `--fix` stays that way: it prints a
**dry-run plan** of concrete commands for the findings on *your* system:

```bash
$ linux-doctor --fix
# linux-doctor --fix (dry run — nothing was executed)
1. [apply] (services/failed) systemctl --user reset-failed 'app-picom@autostart.service'
2. [apply] (timers/broken) sudo systemctl start 'dnf-makecache.timer'
```

Commands come **only** from a small built-in safe-fix catalog (`src/fix.js`)
mapped to stable finding codes — the free-text suggestions in the report are
never executed. Review the plan, then opt in a second time to run it:

```bash
linux-doctor --fix --yes     # runs only [apply]; [manual] items are printed, never executed
```

`[manual]` entries (a pending reboot, firmware updates) are always left for
you to run yourself.

## Interactive mode (`--interactive`)

```bash
linux-doctor --interactive
```

A zero-dependency terminal UI over the report: `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` pick a
finding, `Enter` opens its details and evidence, `c` copies the suggested fix,
and `f` copies the safe-fix command when one exists in the catalog. `q` quits.
Without a TTY (pipes, CI) it falls back to printing the normal report.

## Desktop notifications (`--notify`)

```bash
linux-doctor --notify          # also works with --daemon
```

Sends a native desktop notification via `notify-send` when **new** medium/high
findings appear — so a scheduled agent can tell you about degradation without
a terminal. Needs a graphical session; silently does nothing otherwise.

## Plain output (`--plain`)

```bash
linux-doctor --plain
```

Prints the same report as plain, tab-separated lines — no colors, emoji, or
box drawing — so it works in dumb terminals and pipes cleanly into
`grep`/`awk`. Metadata goes to `#` comment lines; each finding is one
`severity<TAB>number<TAB>title` row with `detail`/`fix` rows right after:

```
# linux-doctor
# system: Bazzite 44 · kernel 6.1.0 · 16 core(s) · up 2h
# score: 53/100
# summary: 1 high, 4 medium, 12 info
high    1   3 services failed to start
fix     1   Inspect one with `systemctl status ...`
```

Exit codes are the same as the normal report, so `--plain` works in cron and
scripts too.

## Shell completions

Shell completions (bash/zsh/fish) are in [completions/](../completions/).
Install them with:

```bash
# bash
install -Dm644 completions/linux-doctor.bash /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/linux-doctor
# zsh
install -Dm644 completions/linux-doctor.zsh /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_linux-doctor
# fish
install -Dm644 completions/linux-doctor.fish ~/.config/fish/completions/linux-doctor.fish
```

## Run checks automatically (systemd timer)

To run checks automatically, enable the systemd timer:

```bash
sudo cp packaging/linux-doctor.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now linux-doctor.timer
```

Under systemd, `--notify` turns the timer into a watchdog: you only hear
about your machine when something new goes wrong.
