# Dashboard & desktop app

The same report, visualized. For downloads and the CLI, see the
[README](../README.md).

## Visual dashboard (`--web`)

```bash
linux-doctor --web
```

Opens a dashboard in your browser at `127.0.0.1:43901` (a stable, predictable
URL — a second instance falls back to a free port instead of crashing). The
layout is organized into four clear zones: **identity** (logo + system info +
actions: notifications, theme, **Export** menu, help, **Re-run checks**),
**status** (health gauge with score/delta, a plain-language message,
NEW/FIXED chips, and a checks chip that opens the all-checks matrix),
**control** (group-by Severity/Category, severity pills with live counts,
search, Auto-refresh, Expand all, Density, Checks, Clear, and thresholds),
and **content** (full-width START HERE, then a shared **notices** row — the
daily-check strip and the security posture as compact one-liners side by
side — then High → Medium → Informational, Fixed, Skipped, Failed checks,
Changes, and history). The spine stays hero → START HERE → findings; when
only one notice is visible it spans the full width instead of leaving a
half-empty column.
The report area is organized into five **views** — **Overview** (today's
report, the default), **History** (score trend, severity charts, and a
newest-first ledger of past runs with per-run deltas), **Checks** (the
all-checks matrix inline, with deep-links back to the findings),
**System** (a full machine wiki — Operating system, Hardware, and Session
sections plus this report's summary), and **Schedule**
(timer status and cadence, notification state, and copy-paste setup,
alert, and heartbeat commands). Tabs carry live count badges (runs,
open problems). Switch from the sidebar navigation (icon + live count badges, Cockpit-style)
on wide screens, the scrollable tab bar below it on narrow ones, keys
`1`–`5`, or the arrow keys while a tab is focused; the choice is remembered.
Secondary panels share a two-column card grid next to START HERE instead of
stacking full-width. Overview
never moves: filters, search, keyboard navigation, and auto-refresh behave
exactly as before, and the background refresh keeps pausing while you read —
an open card in a hidden view never freezes updates.

**IA rule: five views, no more.** Research (NN/g, Hick's law) puts the
sweet spot for top-level navigation at 5–7 items, and each of ours answers
a distinct user question — broken now (Overview), over time (History),
what was checked (Checks), which machine (System), watched tomorrow
(Schedule). New features land *inside* existing views (alert examples live
in Schedule, thresholds in its panel), never as new top-level views; past
7, regroup instead of adding.
The **daily-check strip** answers whether the machine will check itself
tomorrow: it reads the user timer state from `GET /api/schedule` (read-only —
installing stays a CLI decision) and shows **on** (runs after boot, then
daily, notifies only on new findings), **off** (with a one-click copy of
`linux-doctor --install-timer`), or **needs attention** (units exist but the
timer isn't active), plus the browser-alerts state. It stays hidden for
static `--html` exports.
**High** findings are open by default; **Medium**, **Informational**,
**Fixed**, and **Skipped** collapse, so a full report fits on one screen
without scrolling. Click any finding to expand what happened and why it
matters, an **Evidence** expander with a copy button and the check's run
time, plus the recommended next step with **Copy fix**, **Dismiss**, and
**Report** actions. Every card header carries a quiet `code` pill — click it
to copy the stable code, or type `code:<prefix>` in search to filter by it.
Hit **Re-run checks** for a fresh report. The dashboard **auto-refreshes**
every 20s — it pauses while you are reading (searching, filtering, or with a
finding expanded) so your place is never reset, and the Auto button shows
its paused state. Density defaults to compact (more findings per viewport)
and is remembered, like the theme. Pure HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks; the
page served by `--web`, the desktop app, and `--html` exports are all built
from `src-gui/` via `npm run build:gui`.

The **history** view draws your health-score sparkline (with date tooltips
and a dashed 50-point "needs attention" line) plus a stacked bar chart of
high/medium/info findings across recent runs, so you can see at a glance
whether problems are trending up or down. With fewer than two recorded runs
it explains what will appear there instead of vanishing. The **Skipped**
section lists checks that do not apply to this machine profile plus checks
skipped on immutable/atomic systems (e.g. `reboot`).

**Themes:** the dashboard follows your system theme and remembers your
choice — the theme button in the header cycles light → dark → terminal →
auto. **Terminal** is a phosphor-console look (near-black, mono everywhere,
sharp corners, flat surfaces) for sysadmins; same layout and the same
contrast budget as the other themes, only variables change.
**Keyboard navigation:** `↑`/`↓` move between findings, `Enter`/`Space`
opens/closes the focused one, `/` focuses search, `?` shows all shortcuts,
`Esc` closes dialogs/menus/panels or clears search and filters. Every
severity has an icon plus a text label, never color alone; status changes
and confirmations are announced through live regions, and motion honors
`prefers-reduced-motion`. While checks re-run, a spinner shows progress and
the button is disabled.

## Desktop app (GUI)

The same dashboard, as a native desktop window — launch it, and one click on
**Re-run checks** gives you a fresh report. Built with Tauri v2: the window
is a thin Rust shell that runs the exact same Node checks
(`bin/doctor.js --json`), so there is **zero duplication** between the CLI
and the GUI — the checks are the single source of truth.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 20 (the checks run through Node), Rust, and the
Tauri system libraries:

```bash
# Fedora / Bazzite (immutable) — layering applies live, no reboot needed
sudo rpm-ostree install --apply-live webkit2gtk4.1-devel dbus-devel librsvg2-devel libxdo-devel
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential libssl-dev libxdo-dev librsvg2-dev
```

**Run in development:**

```bash
npm install
npm run gui:dev
```

**Build installers (.deb / .rpm / AppImage):**

```bash
npm run gui:build
```

The bundled app needs `node` on PATH to run the checks. Set
`LINUX_DOCTOR_ROOT` to point at a Linux Doctor checkout if the bundled
resources are unavailable.

To put the app in your desktop menu, install the launcher (the deb/rpm
bundles ship one automatically; this is for the AppImage or manual setups):

```bash
install -Dm644 packaging/linux-doctor.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
install -Dm644 src-tauri/icons/128x128.png ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/128x128/apps/linux-doctor.png
```
