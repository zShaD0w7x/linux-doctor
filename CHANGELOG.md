# Changelog

All notable changes to Linux Doctor are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and versioning follows
[SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **Checks**: `network` (default route + DNS), `reboot` (newer kernel installed
  but not booted, `/var/run/reboot-required`), `journald` (journal disk usage),
  `smart` (SMART disk health, graceful without root), `timers` (enabled systemd
  timers that never run), `ntp` (time synchronization), battery capacity wear.
- **JSON v1 schema**: `schemaVersion`, `tool`, `version`, `durationMs`;
  every finding carries `check` and a stable `code`; `--schema` prints the
  JSON Schema document for validators and fleet servers.
- **History diff**: atomic history writes; `diffSinceLast` (`added`/`fixed`)
  in JSON and a "fixed since last check" line in the terminal and `--plain`
  output.
- **Check metadata**: `defineCheck` with `category` and `appliesTo`
  (desktop/laptop/server); `--list` and `--help` group checks by category and
  mark checks that do not apply to the current machine; a full run skips
  irrelevant checks (`--check` always overrides).
- **Plugins**: drop-in checks in `~/.config/linux-doctor/checks/`
  (`LINUX_DOCTOR_PLUGINS` to override) — any `.js` file exporting
  `{ id, run }` becomes a check.
- **Configurable thresholds**: `"thresholds"` in `config.json` tunes every
  severity boundary (disk %, memory ratio, load, temperature, RAM share,
  journal size).
- **Performance**: checks run through a concurrency pool (bounded
  subprocesses); `--profile` reports per-check durations.
- **CLI hygiene**: strict argument parsing (unknown flags and missing values
  exit 2), `--check=id` form, `--push` payload now carries `machineId` and
  `diffSinceLast`.
- **Packaging**: AUR `PKGBUILD`, RPM spec, release workflow, this changelog.
- **CI**: Node 20/22/24 matrix, a Fedora container job, and an npm pack gate
  that guards the published `files` list.

### Fixed

- npm package crashed on every invocation: `src-gui/index.html` (read by
  `web.js` at import time) is now in `files`.
- Same root cause reported twice (journal+suspend, gpu+wayland) and double
  penalized in the health score — now deduplicated via `dedupeKey` and
  deferred patterns.
- `ps -o comm` truncated process names (15 chars) so the friendly-name map
  never matched — now uses `args=`.
- `journalctl` boot separators inflated log checks — filtered in one place.
- `addIgnore` used to overwrite other config keys (e.g. thresholds) — it
  merges now.
- Wireless-device "batteries" (Logitech receivers, controllers) no longer
  report as laptop batteries or mark a desktop as a laptop.
- `systemd list-timers` column parsing was fragile — now slices by the
  header's column offsets.
- `tests/web.test.js` flaked (server banner corrupted the TAP stream) —
  `startWeb` gained a `quiet` option used by tests.
